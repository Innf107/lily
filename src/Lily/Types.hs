{- | The type checking environment.

 Since every name has been renamed in the renamer already, we don't need to fight with scopes
 and can simply thread the environment along in a @State@ effect, instead of passing it
 in a @Reader@.

 This has the downside of being less memory efficient, since we never drop entries, but
 it does make things easier.
